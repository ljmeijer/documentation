Flash: Debugging
================


Where can I find my Flash Player log file?
------------------------------------------


Make sure you've done all of the following:

1) Install "content debugger" version of the Adobe Flash Player plugin from: http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html

2) Go to http://flashplayerversion.com/, and make sure that it says `'Debugger: Yes'` 

3) Be careful using Chrome as it ships with its own Flash Player. If you wish to use Chrome with the debug Flash Player, you can do so by following these instructions: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-google-chrome.html

4) Create a file called mm.cfg which will instruct the Flash Player to create a logfile. The mm.cfg file needs to be placed here:


|    |    |
|:---|:---|
|Macintosh OS X |/Library/Application Support/Macromedia/mm.cfg |
|XP |C:\Documents and Settings\username\mm.cfg |
|Windows Vista/Win7 |C:\Users\username\mm.cfg |
|Linux |/home/username/mm.cfg |

Write this text in the mm.cfg file:

````
ErrorReportingEnable=1
TraceOutputFileEnable=1
````

5) Find and open your flashlog.txt here:



|    |    |
|:---|:---|
|Macintosh OS X|/Users/username/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/Logs/|
|XP|C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\Logs|
|Windows Vista/Win7|C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\Logs
|Linux|/home/username/.macromedia/Flash_Player/Logs/|
Note that whilst your content is running this flashlog.txt will constantly be updated as new debug messages are generated by your script code.  You may need to reload the file or use an editor that can reload as the file grows in size.

More details about enabling debug logs when using SWFs is available at: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=logging_04.html.
