Human Template files
====================


You can save the mapping of bones in your skeleton to the Avatar on disk as a "human template file" (extention `*.ht`), which can be reused by any characters that use this mapping. This is useful, for example, if your animators use a consistent layout and naming convention for all skeleton but Mecanim doesn't know how to interpret it. You can then <span class=menu>Load</span> the .ht file for each model, so that manual remapping only needs to be done once.
