Animation View Guide (Legacy)
=============================


The <span class=keyword>Animation View</span> in Unity allows you to create and modify <span class=keyword>Animation Clips</span> directly inside Unity. It is designed to act as a powerful and straightforward alternative to external 3D animation programs. In addition to animating movement, the editor also allows you to animate variables of materials and components and augment your Animation Clips with <span class=keyword>Animation Events</span>, functions that are called at specified points along the timeline.

See the pages about [Animation import](Animations) and [Animation Scripting](Animation Scripting) for further information about these subject.

The Animation View Guide is broken up into several pages that each focus on different areas of the View:-
