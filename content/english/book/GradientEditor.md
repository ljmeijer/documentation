>Gradient editor 

The <span class=keyword>Gradient Editor</span> is used for describing change of gradient with time. It animates the color (RGB-space, described by the markers at the bottom), and Alpha (described by the markers at the top). 

You can add new _markers_ for Alpha values by clicking near the top of the rectangle, and new ticks for Color by clicking near the bottom. The markers can be intuitively dragged along the timeline. 

If an Alpha tick is selected, you can edit the value for that tick by dragging the alpha value. 

If a Color tick is selected, the color can be modified by double clicking on the tick or clicking on the color bar. 

To remove a _marker_, just drag it off the screen.
