Transforms
==========


<span class=keyword>Transforms</span> are a key <span class=keyword>Component</span> in every <span class=keyword>GameObject</span>.  They dictate where the GameObject is positioned, how it is rotated, and its scale.  It is impossible to have a GameObject without a Transform.  You can adjust the Transform of any GameObject from the <span class=keyword>Scene View</span>, the <span class=keyword>Inspector</span>, or through Scripting.
