Playstation3: Debugging & Profiling
===================================


Please note that all debugging for the PS3 is done inside the ProDG Debugger, which requires the PS3 Source Code.
* Please see https://ps3.scedev.net/docs/sn_videos_mp4 for training videos on different PS3 development aspects including debugging/profiling.

In _'Target Manager_', right click on your your target name and click "Set File System Directory (/app_home/)". Navigate and select <PATH_TO_SOURCE_TREE>/build/PS3Player.

In _'VisualStudio_' select your default project to be PS3Player. Now press the F5/F10 (Run, Run and stop at main) and it will launch the ProDG Debugger.
