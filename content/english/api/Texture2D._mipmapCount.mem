How many mipmap levels are in this texture (RO).

The returned value includes the base level as well, so it is always 1 or more.

Mipmap count is used if you use ::ref::GetPixels or ::ref::SetPixels to fetch or modify
the different mip levels. For example, you could change a texture so that each mip level
is tinted in a different color - then in the game you'd see which mip levels are actually
visible.

SA: ::ref::GetPixels function, ::ref::SetPixels function.
