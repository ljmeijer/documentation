Get a named vector value.

Four component vectors and colors are the same in Unity shaders. /GetVector/ does exactly the same
as ::ref::GetColor just the input data type is different (@@xyzw@@ in the vector becomes @@rgba@@ in the color).

SA: GetColor, SetVector.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	print(renderer.material.GetVector("_Color"));
END EX
