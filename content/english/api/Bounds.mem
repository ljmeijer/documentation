Represents an axis aligned bounding box.

An axis-aligned bounding box, or AABB for short, is a box aligned with coordinate axes and fully enclosing
some object. Because the box is never rotated with respect to the axes, it can be defined by just its
::ref::center and ::ref::extents, or alternatively by ::ref::min and ::ref::max points.
