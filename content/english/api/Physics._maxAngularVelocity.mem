The default maximimum angular velocity permitted for any rigid bodies (default 7). Must be positive.
The angular velocity of rigidbodies is clamped to maxAngularVelocity to avoid numerical instability with fast rotating bodies.
Because this may prevent intentional fast rotations on objects such as wheels, you can override this value per rigidbody using Rigidbody.maxAngularVelocity.

This value is usually changed in @@Edit->Project Settings->Physics@@ inspector instead of from scripts.
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX

	Physics.maxAngularVelocity = 10;
END EX
