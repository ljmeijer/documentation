MonoBehaviour is the base class every script derives from.

Using Javascript every script automatically derives from MonoBehaviour.
When using C# or Boo you have to explicitly derive from MonoBehaviour.

__Note:__ The checkbox for disabling a MonoBehavior (on the editor) will only 
prevent Start(), Awake(), Update(), FixedUpdate(), and OnGUI() from executing. 
If none of these functions are present, the checkbox is not displayed.
